Secure Login System with Dynamic Password Reset

This project is my senior year(Spring 2010) which was developed with an intention of curbing the menace 
of getting the password or personal information stolen with various tools like Keyloggers 
or Malware on public computers. This dynamically resets the password while logging in and 
sends a new dynamically generated password to the user's registered mobile/secondary email 
and thus rendering the old password useless. 

We have used a third party mobile gateway to send the messages to the user's mobile. 
The alternatives that could be used currently are Twilio or Tropo and the like. They have 
really good and cost effective services.
